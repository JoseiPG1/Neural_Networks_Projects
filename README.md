# Neural_Networks_Projects
On this repository I will be uploading different types of neural networks projects that I am currently involved. Generally speaking the way to approach a neural network optimization problem is 
1. Load the data, and convert the data into tensors.
2. Use sklearn libraries to split the data.
3. Design the neuronal network.
4. Save the model.
5. Evaluated the model using the testing data.
  
When designed the neuronal network, keep in mind you need to decided weather to build the ANN as a class or as a sequential NN, along with the activation functions and the feedforward pass. Once you have the ANN, you need to define the loss function and the optmization process. Then you itare the optimzation until you minimize the loss function.

### Project [1] : Predicting Residential EV Charging Loads using Neural Networks:
- [X] Task 1: is collecting/loading the data and merging the useful columns.
- [X] Task 2: is the data cleaning and preparation.
- [X] Taks 3: is the train split section using sklearn libraries.
- [X] Task 4: performing a simple linear regreassion using sklearn libraries.
- [X] Taks 5: design the neural network and tested.
- [X] Taks 6: load a previous model and compare performance.

### Project [2] : Predicting the rent based on numerical features using Neural Networks:
- [X] Task 1: import and cleaning the data.
- [X] Task 2: selecting features.
- [X] Taks 3: is the train split.
- [X] Task 4: desing the neural network, define the loss function and optimizer.
- [X] Taks 5: training loop.
- [X] Taks 6: save and test the model.
